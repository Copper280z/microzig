# Zig Embedded Group

This group was formed to document and improve the embedded programming experience with the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org).

Right now, this group has the following members:

- [Felix "xq" Quei√üner](https://github.com/masterQ32/)
- [Matthew "mattnite" Knight](https://github.com/mattnite/)
- [Vesim](https://github.com/vesim987/)
- [Timon "FireFox317" Kruiper](https://github.com/FireFox317)
- [Martin "SpexGuy" Wickham](https://github.com/SpexGuy)

## Goals

- Provide documents on how to get started with embedded programming (for absolute newbies)
- Provide example snippets for certain architectures (LPC, STM32, AVR, ...)
- Create register definition libraries
- Create a common interface/HAL over several architectures
- Create a <i>performant</i> common set of drivers for external platforms

## Community

This group uses the already existing community infrastructures that exist for Zig:

- [Zig Programming Language - Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TyzJXjser6)

## Planned Documents/Articles

- Getting started with embedded (not specific to a platform)  
  Contains info about basic digital electronics, what MMIO is and how it works, what are the differences to "normal" programs how is the startup pocess, ...
- Getting started with
  - Arduino/AVR
  - LPC1768
  - STM32
  - MSP430
  - ESP2866/ESP32
  - NRF52
  - Raspberry PI
- Using `async` code on embedded.
- Make your own keyboard with zig (and replace qmk)

## Required Stuff
